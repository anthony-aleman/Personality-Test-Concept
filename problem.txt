Given an array of 25 Responses with possible responses being
'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E' generate 8 scores with their 
corresponding dimension of wellness. 

Personality test problem. I created 25 questions for a group of
people likely experiencing some form of AUHDHD/Autism/ADHD. 
Each question has a relation of some form to the 8 dimensions of wellness. 
Many of the users would likely experience similar problems but have different
goals or different preferences on how they want to achieve their goals. 

To determine the score for each question response I will assign points to each 
response 'A': 4, 'B': 3, 'C': 2, 'D': 1, 'E': 0.5

Each question will have stronger relations to certain 
areas of wellness, but most questions have overlapping areas. To factor
this in to the calculation I will create a modifier that will differ based
on the extent it relates to the corresponding dimension

For Example: 

How frequently do you find yourself overwhelmed by tasks or responsibilities?
A) Daily
B) Weekly
C) Monthly
D) Rarely
E) Never

This question relates to all of the dimensions of wellness. This would mean
that each dimension would apply here but to say perhaps in a young working class persons
life Social, Occupational, Financial, and Intellectual would most likely apply. 
Each related dimension would have a corresponding weighted modifier indicating, 
High (x1.75), Med (x1.5), Low (x1.1) significance
So lets say for every dimension we apply the Low modifier except for the 4 stated
where we instead apply a High modifier visually that looks like this

Spiritual x 1.1
Physical x 1.1
Occupational x 1.75
Social x 1.75
Financial x 1.75
Environmental x 1.1
Intellectual x 1.75
Emotional x 1.1
